# Frontend Changes: Dark/Light Theme Toggle

This document outlines the changes made to implement a dark/light theme toggle feature in the RAG chatbot interface.

## Overview

Added a complete theme switching system that allows users to toggle between dark and light themes with smooth transitions and proper accessibility support.

- Uses semantic HTML with `aria-label` for screen reader support

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **Lines 37-63**: Added light theme CSS custom properties (variables)
  - Light backgrounds (`--background: #ffffff`, `--surface: #f8fafc`)
  - Dark text for good contrast (`--text-primary: #1e293b`, `--text-secondary: #64748b`)
  - Adjusted colors for borders, shadows, and interactive elements
  - Updated source link styling for light theme

- **Lines 832-918**: Added theme toggle button styling
  - Positioned absolutely in top-right corner
  - Smooth hover and focus effects

  - Responsive design adjustments for mobile devices

- **Lines 899-905**: Added global smooth transition effects

  - Uses cubic-bezier timing function for professional feel

### 3. `frontend/script.js`

- **Lines 306-332**: Added complete theme management system
  - `initializeTheme()`: Loads saved theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()`: Switches between light and dark themes
  - `getCurrentTheme()`: Gets current theme state
  - `setTheme()`: Applies theme and updates accessibility labels

## Features Implemented

### 1. Toggle Button Design
- ✅ Icon-based design with sun (light theme) and moon (dark theme) icons
- ✅ Positioned in top-right corner as requested
- ✅ Smooth transition animations with rotation and scaling effects
- ✅ Professional hover and focus states
- ✅ Accessibility-compliant with keyboard navigation support

### 2. Light Theme CSS Variables
- ✅ Light background colors with proper contrast ratios
- ✅ Dark text colors for excellent readability
- ✅ Adjusted primary and secondary colors that work in both themes
- ✅ Updated border and surface colors for visual consistency
- ✅ Maintains accessibility standards (WCAG compliance)

### 3. JavaScript Functionality
- ✅ Theme persistence using localStorage
- ✅ Smooth transitions between themes using CSS transitions
- ✅ Keyboard accessibility (Enter/Space key support)
- ✅ Dynamic ARIA label updates for screen readers

### 4. Implementation Details
- ✅ Uses CSS custom properties for efficient theme switching
- ✅ `data-theme` attribute on document root for theme detection
- ✅ All existing elements work seamlessly in both themes
- ✅ Maintains current visual hierarchy and design language
- ✅ Responsive design that works on mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Theme System Architecture
1. **CSS Variables**: All colors are defined as CSS custom properties in `:root` for dark theme and `:root[data-theme="light"]` for light theme
2. **Data Attribute**: Theme state is managed via `data-theme` attribute on the document element
3. **localStorage Persistence**: User's theme preference is saved and restored on page load
4. **Smooth Transitions**: Global transition rules provide smooth theme switching animations

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Toggle button responds to Enter and Space keys
- **ARIA Labels**: Dynamic aria-label updates to inform screen readers of current state
- **Focus Indicators**: Proper focus ring styling for keyboard users
- **Color Contrast**: Both themes meet WCAG AA contrast ratio requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Uses CSS custom properties (supported in all modern browsers)
- **Fallback**: Default dark theme for browsers without CSS custom property support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Theme toggle gracefully degrades if JavaScript is disabled

## Usage

Users can now:
1. Click the theme toggle button in the top-right corner to switch themes
2. Use keyboard navigation (Tab to focus, Enter/Space to activate)
3. Have their theme preference remembered between sessions
4. Enjoy smooth transitions when switching themes

The theme system integrates seamlessly with the existing RAG chatbot interface while maintaining all original functionality and visual design principles.
